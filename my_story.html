    Beautiful Bangladesh is a small country in South Asia & that’s where I am from. 

    Being an only child in a broken family doesn’t help – but I have had an awesome life and things turned out pretty okay.
                    
    I was born on Nov 19th, 1999. I went to a decent school called BMARPC, then joined a college called BNMPC 
    & then did my BSc in CSE from ULAB. I lived with my mom for the entirety who loves me to death.
                    
    Being an only child – I received all the love I could from my immediate and extended family which made
    me soft & vulnerable but If I had to do it all over again, I don’t think I would have changed 
    anything. 
                    
    I had a lot of friends when I was in school – and if given a chance, those are the days I would want
    back. Playing cricket without a bit of worry all day, reading storybooks in the dark damaging your 
    eyes, good old days. 
                    
    I was entrepreneurial from the school days – the first business, as I remember was renting books to
    friends for pocket money which I started with a friend. 
                    
    There’s a saying – How come you don’t know you are in the good old days, when you are in the good old days. 
                    
    I am getting old, nostalgic and I think about that every day now.
